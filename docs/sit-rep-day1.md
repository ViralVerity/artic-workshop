The Ministry of Health, WHO and partners continue to respond to the Lethal Haemorrhagic Fever Virus (LHFV) outbreak in Country X and, despite ongoing challenges, remain confident that the outbreak can be contained. 
The Ministry of Health notified the WHO of an epidemic of LHFV on October 3rd after a large cluster of individuals presented with a fever of unknown aetiology.
The index case visited the clinic on the 13th of September in the northern region of Health District A. 

This is the 8th outbreak since the virus was discovered. 
LHFV is a zoonotic virus that has caused sporadic outbreaks since the 1970s. 
The first outbreak of LHFV occurred in 1977 in a village next to the Lethal Haemorrhagic Fever River, which gave the virus its name. 

As of December 7th, a total of 35 confirmed cases, including 25 deaths, have been reported across two health zones. 
Sampling efforts and contact tracing have provided a publically-available anonymised line list and whole viral genome sequences for these cases. 
The Ministry of Health, WHO and partners are monitoring and investigating all alerts in affected areas.

This week, 6 probable cases have been brought to attention as individuals in Health District A presented to the clinic with symptoms of acute haemorrhagic fever and were admitted to hospital. 
Blood samples were taken from these hospitalized patients and are yet to be processed. 
Investigations continue to establish the full extent of the outbreak.
